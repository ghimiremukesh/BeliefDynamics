    "### Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and its application to Kuhn Poker\n",

    "Kuhn Poker is a simple 3-card poker game created by Harold E. Kuhn. Two players each bet 1 chip blind into the pot before the deal. Three cards (usually K, Q, and J) are suffled, and one card is dealt to each player and held as private information in the original Kuhn Poker game. We implement the game as described in the above paper with additional change as inspired by the [ReBeL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13544) paper. Players do not have any private information -- a referee observes the players' cards and makes decision based on the players' strategy which they announce in the beginning of the game. The players then update their belief based on how the other player's play and simultaneously update their strategy. Further information can be found on the paper.  "
